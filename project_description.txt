Project Description: Rating prediction based on KNN fused Latent Feature Model. (KLFM)

Data Description and Usage.

Training data: 1. Used for training latent factor model (LFM) and KLFM

Valid data:  (user, place) pair ----> to predict the rating by calculating the MSE 
		fine tuning model based on this data

Test data: (user, place) â€”-> predict rating


Pipeline:
We would be training two models.
1. Basic latent factor model (alpha + beta U + beta I + gamma U * gamma I)
2. KNN fused latent factor model (alpha + beta U + beta I + (gamma I  + distance metric) * gamma U)

Distance metric = 1/|set of neighbours| * sum(d) where d is the parameter.
